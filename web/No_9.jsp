        <h3>A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</h3>
        
        <br><b>General Description</b>
        <br>Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost always run with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited,
        <br>such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application
        <br>defenses and enable a range of possible attacks and impacts.
        <br>
        <br><b>Typical Impact</b>
        <br>Full range of weaknesses is possible, including injection, broken access control, XSS ...
        <br>The impact could range from minimal to complete host takeover and data compromise
        <br>
        <br><b>Typical Attack Scenario</b>
        <br>1. Attacker sets the trap on some website on the internet(or simply via an e-mail)
        <br>2. While logged into vulnerable site,victim views attacker site
        <br>3. Vulnerable site sees legitimate request from victim and performs the action requested
        <br>
        <br><b>Avoided by...</b>
        <br><b>>>Ideal<<</b>
        <br>Automation checks periodically (e.g., nightly build) to see if your libraries are out of date
        <br>Even better, automation also tells you about known vulnerabilities
        <br>
        <br><b>>>Minimum<<</b>
        <br>By hand, periodically check to see if your libraries are out of date and upgrade those that are
        <br>If any are out of date, but you really donâ€™t want to upgrade, check to see if there are any known security issues with these out of data libraries
        <br>If so, upgrade those
        <br>
        <br><b>>>Could also<<</b> 
        <br>By hand, periodically check to see if any of your libraries have any known vulnerabilities at this time
        <br>>>Check CVE, other vuln repositories
        <br>>>If any do, update at least these
